    <h1>The Trip</h1>
    <h3>by Still Corners</h3>
    <p>
       Time has come to go<br>
       Pack your bags, hit the open road<br>
       Our hearts just won't die<br>
       It's the trip, keeps us alive<br>
       They're following some dance of light<br>
       Tearing into the night<br>
       Watching you fall asleep<br>
       The sweetest dove in a dream<br>
       So many miles<br>
       Away<br>
    </p>
